            <h3>Learn About Nature and Ecosystems
            </h3>
            <p>Ecosystems are complicated and more difficult than caring for a potted plant.
                A vivarium contains an entire ecosystem that is able to support itself with <i><small>little</small></i>
                help from the one maintaining the system.
                In order to setup a mini container containing the cycle of life, it is necessary to know what will be
                happening in said container.
                They consist of substrate, drainage layer, various plant life, a cleanup crew (bugs) to remove waste,
                and of course a beloved small pet.
                All of the life is essential to the rest, and it's easy for things to go wrong and become out of
                balance.
                Mold can grow excessively if the area is too damp, certain plants may not be compatible with the choosen
                climate or with each other,
                and the bugs that eat the waste may die out.

            <h3>Care for Other Living Beings
            </h3>
            <p>Caring for pets is proven to have several health benefits according to the CDC such as a decrease in
                blood pressure,
                anxiety, feelings of loneliness, and symptoms of PTSD.
                The enclosure primarily needs to care for the animal inhabiting it, but it's not the only living thing
                being cared for.
                The plant life, and cleanup crew play an important part in upholding a livable environment along with
                the pet too.
                Your pet will have a natural home similar to one out in nature.

            <h3>A piece of nature in your home
            </h3>
            <p>Another benefit to terrariums/vivariums is that they are pleasing to look at and makes great decor.
                Not only is it pleasing to look at but it makes for great visual interest as its not just static piece
                of furniture.
                Because the system is alive, everyday it will look a little bit different, and theres always a little
                critter to observe.
                It's like having a little piece of nature in your home, which can feel rejuvinating.
                It's unique and can be a conversation piece when having people over.
